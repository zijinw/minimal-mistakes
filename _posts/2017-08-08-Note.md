# Suddenly I find something

I found that it is very common to deal with problems with two string's comparison by 2-D DP.

And when you plot the 2-D table out, you will find that we should not move two pointers at the same time. Instead, we should look at the table row by row (column by column), which means fix one pointer and just move the other one.
